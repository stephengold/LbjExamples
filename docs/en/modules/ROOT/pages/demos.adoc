_Demo applications_ are provided to showcase certain features of {Project}.
The following demos are found in
{url-examples}[the com.github.stephengold.lbjexamples package of the "apps" sub-project]:

* {url-examples}/NewtonsCradle.java[`NewtonsCradle`]
  demonstrates dynamic restitution and point-to-point joints
* {url-examples}/Pachinko.java[`Pachinko`]
  demonstrates compound collision shapes and 2-D physics
* {url-examples}/ThousandCubes.java[`ThousandCubes`]
  demonstrates stacking cubes and launching projectiles

(Not all applications in the package are intended as demos.)

== User interface

The demos are controlled by primarily by keyboard input.

NOTE: The descriptions below assume a keyboard with the "US" (QWERTY) layout.
On keyboards with other layouts, the keys may be labeled differently.

For convenience, the mapping of keys to actions is partly standardized.
In most demos:

* kbd:[.] and kbd:[Pause] toggle the simulation between running and paused,
* kbd:[C] dumps the camera's position to the console, and
* kbd:[Esc] ends the application.

For camera control, all demos use `Immediate` rotation mode.
This means you can rotate the camera by simply moving the mouse.
Furthermore:

* kbd:[W] and kbd:[S] dolly the camera forward and back, respectively,
* kbd:[A] and kbd:[D] dolly the camera left and right, respectively,
* kbd:[Q] raises the camera, and
* kbd:[Z] lowers the camera.

Additional mappings are specific to each application:

* In `NewtonsCradle`:

** kbd:[F1], kbd:[1], and kbd:[Numpad1] restart with a single ball
** kbd:[F2], kbd:[2], and kbd:[Numpad2] restart with 2 balls
** kbd:[F3], kbd:[3], and kbd:[Numpad3] restart with 3 balls
** kbd:[F4], kbd:[4], and kbd:[Numpad4] restart with 4 balls

* In `Pachinko`:

** kbd:[F4], kbd:[4], and kbd:[Numpad4] restart with 4 rows of pins
** kbd:[F5], kbd:[5], and kbd:[Numpad5] restart with 5 rows of pins
** kbd:[F6], kbd:[6], and kbd:[Numpad6] restart with 6 rows of pins
** kbd:[F7], kbd:[7], and kbd:[Numpad7] restart with 7 rows of pins
** kbd:[F8], kbd:[8], and kbd:[Numpad8] restart with 8 rows of pins
** kbd:[F9], kbd:[9], and kbd:[Numpad9] restart with 9 rows of pins

* In `ThousandCubes`:

** kbd:[E] launch a red ball
