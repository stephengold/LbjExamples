A _physics joint_ connects one physics body to another
(or to a fixed point in space), constraining how the body(s) can move.

For instance, a door might swing on hinges.
In simulation, the hinges would be represented by a joint
with a single _degree of freedom_ (DOF):
rotation around the axis of the hinges.
Such joints are called _hinge joints_.

Or a door might slide along a track.
In that case, the track would be represented by a joint
that’s free to translate, but only along the axis of the track.
To simulate this, you'd use a joint with one translational DOF,
called a _slider joint_.

Or imagine a pen holder mounted on a ball-and-socket:
it can freely turn and twist to any orientation,
but the ball end can’t leave the socket.
To simulate this, you'd use a joint with 3 rotational DOFs,
called a _point-to-point joint_.

Some physics joints can connect soft bodies or portions thereof.
In {Project}, a joint that can only connect rigid bodies
is called a _constraint_.

{url-api}/joints/New6Dof.html[`New6Dof`] is a constraint
that replaces the older {url-api}/joints/SixDofJoint.html[`SixDofJoint`]
and {url-api}/joints/SixDofSpringJoint.html[`SixDofSpringJoint`] constraints.
As its name implies,
`New6Dof` can simulate up to 6 DOFs.
It's so versatile, it can also emulate 4 other constraints:

. {url-api}/joints/ConeJoint.html[`ConeJoint`]
. {url-api}/joints/HingeJoint.html[`HingeJoint`]
. {url-api}/joints/Point2PointJoint.html[`Point2PointJoint`]
. {url-api}/joints/SliderJoint.html[`SliderJoint`]

It might be the only physics joint you'll ever need.

== Features

A `New6Dof` constraint can be instantiated
either as a _double-ended_ constraint (connecting 2 rigid bodies)
or as a _single-ended_ constraint (connecting a rigid body to a fixed point).

`New6Dof` can simulate up to 3 rotation DOFs
and up to 3 translation DOFs, so an instance
can potentially rotate or slide on any axis or axes.
By default, the translation DOFs are _locked_ at a zero,
while the rotation DOFs are _free_ to assume any angular value.
In other words, it defaults to a point-to-point joint.

By locking and/or unlocking DOFs, you simulate different types of joints:

* For a hinge joint, lock all but one of the rotation DOFs.
* For a slider joint, lock all 3 rotation DOFs
  and unlock one of the translation DOFs.

In addition to being locked or free, there's a 3rd possibility;
a DOF can be _limited_:  allowed to assume values only in a specific range.
By imposing limits, you can prevent a door from sliding or swinging
beyond certain points.

In addition to limits, `New6Dof`
also implements motors, servos, and springs:

* Using a _motor_, you can apply forces to open or close a door.
* Using a _servo_, you can cause a door
  to move smoothly to a specific position, as if under remote control.
* Using a _spring_, you can cause a door to automatically return
  to a neutral position when released.

You can also:

* specify the order in which axis rotations are combined,
* disable a constraint temporarily,
* configure the amount of applied impulse that will
  _break_ (permanently disable) a constraint,
* customize the number of iterations used to solve a constraint, and
* (for a double-ended constraint) configure
  whether collisions between the end bodies should be simulated or not.

== Caveats

A `New6Dof` constraint
can only connect rigid bodies (including vehicles):
no ghost objects, characters, multibodies, or soft bodies.

For a constraint to be effective:

* the constraint and its connected body(s)
  must all be added to the same physics space, and
* at least one of its ends must be a dynamic rigid body.

Even when locked, constraints exhibit some softness.
A strong force, torque, or impulse can drag a locked DOF out of position
or overpower the limits of a limited DOF.
This is because the contact-and-constraint solver
doesn't immediately correct all position errors in physics joints.
During each simulation step, it corrects only a fraction of each error,
by default, 20%.
This fraction is the solver's _error-reduction parameter_ (ERP).

For faster corrections (with more risk of instability) increase the ERP.
For instance, to correct 90% of joint-position errors during each simulation step:

[source,java]
----
physicsSpace.getSolverInfo().setJointErp(0.9f); // default=0.2
----

== Constructors

The ends of a double-ended physics joint are denoted "A" and "B",
based on their order of appearance in the constructor.

By convention, the body connected to a single-ended
`New6Dof` is denoted "B".
In effect, the "A" end of a single-ended constraint
connects to the physics space itself.

NOTE: Certain other {url-api}/joints/Constraint.html[`Constraint`]
subclasses use the opposite end-naming convention for single-ended constraints.

There are 2 `New6Dof` constructors,
one for a single-ended constraint:

[source,java]
----
new New6Dof(rigidBodyB, pivotInB, pivotInWorld, rotInB, rotInWorld,
            rotationOrder);
----

and one for a double-ended constraint:

[source,java]
----
new New6Dof(rigidBodyA, rigidBodyB, pivotInA, pivotInB,
            rotInA, rotInB, rotationOrder);
----

The "pivot" and "rot" parameters define coordinate systems
used in the constraint.

Consider that a constraint potentially involves 4 coordinate systems:

. the local coordinate system of the rigid body at the "B" end,
. B's notion of the constraint coordinate system,
. the coordinate system of the "A" end, which is either:
.. the local coordinate system of the rigid body
   (in a double-ended constraint) or else
.. the physics-space coordinate system (in a single-ended constraint), AND
. A's notion of the constraint coordinate system.

If all 6 DOFs were locked, then satisfying the constraint
would involve making system #2 match system #4 exactly.

For a constraint that rotates,
the pivot point should be the origin of the constraint's coordinate system.

Each "pivot" parameter is defines the origin of a coordinate system,
and each "rot" parameter defines its orientation.
(Each "pivot" is an offset vector, and each "rot" is a
{url-enwiki}/Orthogonal_matrix[rotation matrix].)
To transform a location vector from system #2 to system #1,
one would multiply by the `rotInB` matrix and then add the `pivotInB` vector.
To transform a location vector from system #4 to system #3,
one would multiply by the `rotInA` (or `rotInWorld`) matrix
and then add the `pivotInA` (or `pivotInWorld`) vector.

TIP: To reduce complexity, it helps to initially position
the constraint and its end body(s) so that their local coordinate systems
all share the same orientation.
Then you can specify `Matrix3f.IDENTITY` for each "rot" parameter.

=== Example apps

{url-tutorial}/HelloJoint.java[HelloJoint] (also {url-kt}/HelloJoint.kt[in Kotlin]) is a SPORT app
that demonstrates a single-ended `New6Dof` constraint.

Things to notice while running the app:

. The gray paddle is kinematic, moved by the mouse.
. A magenta ball hangs from a single-ended point-to-point joint,
  indicated by the red arrow.
. If you strike the ball with the paddle, it swings around, maintaining
  a constant distance from the pivot point.

{url-tutorial}/HelloDoubleEnded.java[HelloDoubleEnded] (also {url-kt}/HelloDoubleEnded.kt[in Kotlin]) is a SPORT app
that demonstrates a double-ended `New6Dof` constraint.

Things to notice while running the app:

. The gray paddle is moved by the mouse.
. A double-ended point-to-point joint (indicated by red and green arrows)
  connects the ball to the paddle.
. If the paddle moves fast enough, the red and green arrows no longer meet.
  Even though all 3 translation DOFs are locked, the paddle's
  motion drags them out of position.

== Limits

The degrees of freedom are indexed as follows...

* 0: translation parallel to the X axis
* 1: translation parallel to the Y axis
* 2: translation parallel to the Z axis
* 3: rotation around the X axis
* 4: rotation around the Y axis
* 5: rotation around the Z axis

To impose limits on a DOF that is locked or free,
use the `set()` method with lowerLimit &lt; upperLimit.

[source,java]
----
constraint.set(MotorParam.LowerLimit, dofIndex, lowerLimit);
constraint.set(MotorParam.UpperLimit, dofIndex, upperLimit);
----

To lock a DOF that is limited or free, set both limits to the same value.

To free a DOF that is limited or locked,
use the `set()` method with lowerLimit &gt; upperLimit.
(For a free DOF, the precise limit values have no significance.)

NOTE: The limits of a rotational DOF are measured in radians.

{url-tutorial}/HelloLimit.java[HelloLimit] (also {url-kt}/HelloLimit.kt[in Kotlin]) is a SPORT app
that demonstrates a single-ended `New6Dof` constraint
with limited translation DOFs.
The joint's translations are limited,
confining the ball to a horizontal square centered on the origin.

== Motors

Motors are used to apply forces to a constraint.
In `New6Dof`, each DOF has its own motor, which is disabled by default.

{url-tutorial}/HelloMotor.java[HelloMotor] (also {url-kt}/HelloMotor.kt[in Kotlin]) is a SPORT app
that demonstrates a double-ended `New6Dof`
with its Y-rotation motor enabled.

. All DOFs except Y rotation are locked at zero.
. Y rotation is limited between 0 and 1.2 radians.
. The pivot is located just to the left of the door.
. Press kbd:[Space bar] to reverse the direction of the motor.

The force (or torque) applied by each motor is limited.
To change this limit,
use the `set()` method with `MotorParam.MaxMotorForce`:

[source,java]
----
constraint.set(MotorParam.MaxMotorForce, dofIndex, force);
----

NOTE: For translation DOFs, the default maximum force is zero!

== Servos

It's difficult to position a constraint using motors alone.
Without positional feedback,
the constraint tends to keep accelerating until some limit is hit.
Servos implement feedback, allowing for smooth, gradual motion.
In `New6Dof`, each DOF has its own servo, which is disabled by default.

NOTE: For a servo to be effective, its corresponding motor must also be enabled.

{url-tutorial}/HelloServo.java[HelloServo] (also {url-kt}/HelloServo.kt[in Kotlin]) is a SPORT app
that demonstrates a double-ended `New6Dof` constraint
with its Y-rotation servo enabled.

. All DOFs except Y rotation are locked at zero.
. Y rotation is limited between 0 and 1.2 radians.
. The pivot is located just to the left of the door.
. Press kbd:[1] to gradually open the door all the way.
. Press kbd:[3] to gradually rotate the door
  to the one-third open position.
. Press kbd:[4] to gradually close the door all the way.

To adjust a servo's rate of motion,
use the `set()` method with `MotorParam.TargetVelocity`:

[source,java]
----
constraint.set(MotorParam.TargetVelocity, dofIndex, velocity);
----

NOTE: The default target velocity is zero!

== Springs

By default, a DOF that's limited or free has no preferred position.
To change this, enable the DOF's spring
and set its stiffness to a positive value.
If desired, you can also configure
the spring's equilibrium value and damping ratio.

{url-tutorial}/HelloSpring.java[HelloSpring] (also {url-kt}/HelloSpring.kt[in Kotlin]) is a SPORT app
that demonstrates a single-ended constraint with springs.

Things to notice while running the app:

. The joint's X and Z translation DOFs are free.
. Springs on the X and Z translation DOFs
  cause the ball to accelerate toward its equilibrium location.
. Since there's no damping, the ball tends to oscillate.

== Summary

* Physics joints constrain the motion of connected bodies.
* In {Project}, joints for rigid bodies are called constraints.
* `New6Dof` is a versatile constraint
  with 6 degrees of freedom (DOFs).
  It can emulate hinges, sliders, and point-to-point joints.
* Constraint DOFs will exhibit some softness, even when locked.
  This can be mitigated by increasing the error-reduction parameter (ERP).
* `New6Dof` also implements limits, motors, servos, and springs.
