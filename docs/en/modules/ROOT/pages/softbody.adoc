While rope, cloth, and foam rubber
can be simulated using many small rigid bodies,
it is more convenient and efficient to treat them
as individual bodies that can be deformed.
To this end, {Project} supports simulation of soft bodies
in a manner roughly analogous to rigid bodies:

* In place of {url-api}/PhysicsSpace.html[`PhysicsSpace`],
  use {url-api}/PhysicsSoftSpace.html[`PhysicsSoftSpace`].
* In place of {url-api}/objects/PhysicsRigidBody.html[`PhysicsRigidBody`],
  use {url-api}/objects/PhysicsSoftBody.html[`PhysicsSoftBody`].

`PhysicsSoftSpace` is a subclass of `PhysicsSpace`.
It implements soft-body physics in addition to all the
features of an ordinary `PhysicsSpace` (such as rigid bodies).

The abstract class {url-api}/PhysicsBody.html[`PhysicsBody`]
is a superclass of both `PhysicsRigidBody` and `PhysicsSoftBody`.
It provides access to properties that rigid bodies and soft bodies
have in common, such as gravity, location, mass, and joints.

Soft bodies can collide with both rigid bodies and other soft bodies.
They can also be joined to bodies of both types, using special subclasses
of `PhysicsJoint`.


== A comparison of soft bodies and rigid bodies

Unlike a rigid body, a soft body doesn't have a `CollisionShape` or
an orientation.
Instead, it is composed of point masses (called "nodes") whose locations
are specified in physics-space coordinates.
A soft body's shape, structure, mass distribution, and position are all defined
by its mesh of nodes:

* To simulate rope, nodes can be connected in pairs (called _links_).
* To simulate cloth, nodes can be connected to form triangles (called _faces_).
* To simulate foam rubber, nodes can be connected to form tetrahedra (also
   called _tetras_).

Unlike a rigid body, the physics location of a soft body is not its center
of mass, but rather the center of its axis-aligned bounding box.

Like rigid bodies, soft bodies have collision margins.
However, since a soft body lacks a `CollisionShape`,
different accessors are used:

[source,java]
----
float oldMargin = softBody.margin();
softBody.setMargin(0.1f);
----

Soft bodies lack many other features of rigid bodies, including:

* motion state (for extrapolating between simulation steps),
* deactivation/sleeping (for efficient simulation), and
* continuous collision detection (CCD) (for fast-moving objects).


== Constructing a soft body

To construct a soft body, start with the no-argument constructor:

[source,java]
----
PhysicsSoftBody softBody = new PhysicsSoftBody()
----

This produces an empty body (one without any nodes, links, faces, tetras,
or joints) that isn't added to any physics space.

Methods are provided to append nodes, links, and faces to a soft body.
However, it's often more convenient to generate a
https://stephengold.github.io/Libbulletjme/javadoc/master/jme3utilities/lbj/Mesh.html[`Mesh`]
with the desired shape and topology and append it to the body
using a utility method:

* `NativeSoftBodyUtil.appendFromTriMesh()`
  to append nodes and faces from a mesh composed of triangles
* `NativeSoftBodyUtil.appendFromLineMesh()`
  to append nodes and links from a mesh composed of lines

Be aware that meshes intended for graphics rendering often prove
unsuitable for soft-body simulation.
For instance, they may define multiple vertices at the same position
or their edges/faces may be insufficiently subdivided.


== Soft-body configuration and pose matching

Each soft body has numerous properties that can affect its behavior.
Most of these are stored in its configuration object, which can be
accessed using `getSoftConfig()`.
Soft bodies and configuration objects are one-to-one.

Configuration properties with `float` values are enumerated
by the `Sbcp` ("soft-body configuration parameter") enum.
For instance, a soft body can have a preferred shape (called its "default pose")
that it tends to return to when deformed.
The strength of this tendency depends on the configuration object's
"pose matching" parameter, which defaults to zero.

For a simple example of a soft body, see
{url-tutorial}/HelloSoftBody.java[HelloSoftBody].


== Soft-soft collisions

By default, collisions between soft bodies are not handled (ignored).
One way to handle soft-soft collisions for a specific body is to
set the `VF_SS` collision flag in its configuration object:

[source,java]
----
SoftBodyConfig config = softBody.getSoftConfig();
int oldFlags = config.getCollisionFlags();
config.setCollisionFlags(oldFlags, ConfigFlag.VF_SS);
----

For a simple example of a collision between 2 soft bodies, see
{url-tutorial}/HelloSoftSoft.java[HelloSoftSoft].


== Solver iterations

During each simulation step, Bullet applies a series of
iterative solvers to each soft body:

* a cluster solver
* a drift solver
* a position solver
* a velocity solver

The number of iterations for each solver is stored in the body's
configuration object.
When simulating collisions, you can often improve accuracy by increasing the
number of position-solver iterations:

[source,java]
----
SoftBodyConfig config = softBody.getSoftConfig();
config.setPositionIterations(numIterations);  // default=1
----


== Stiffness coefficients

Each soft body has 3 stiffness coefficients.
These are stored in its "material" object,
which can be accessed using `getSoftMaterial()`.
Soft bodies and their material objects are one-to-one.

To simulate an object that flexes easily (such as cloth), create a soft
body with many faces and set its angular-stiffness coefficient
to a small value (such as zero):

[source,java]
----
PhysicsSoftBody.Material softMaterial = softBody.getSoftMaterial();
softMaterial.setAngularStiffness(0f); // default=1
----

For a simple example of cloth simulation, see
{url-tutorial}/HelloCloth.java[HelloCloth].


== Mass distribution

When a node is appended to a soft body, it has mass=1.
To alter the mass of a pre-existing node, use the `setNodeMass()` method:

[source,java]
----
softBody.setNodeMass(nodeIndex, desiredMass);
----

You can also alter the total mass of a soft body, distributing the mass across
the pre-existing nodes in various ways:

* in proportion to the current mass of each node, using `setMassByCurrent()`,
* in proportion to the area of adjacent faces, using `setMassByArea()`, or
* in a custom fashion, using `setMasses()`.

`softBody.setMass()` is equivalent to `setMassByCurrent()`.

If a soft-body node has mass=0, it becomes _pinned_ (immovable, like a static
rigid body).

For a simple example of a pinned node, see
{url-tutorial}/HelloPin.java[HelloPin.java].


== Simulating a rope

{url-tutorial}/HelloSoftRope.java[HelloSoftRope] is a SPORT app
that demonstrates one way to simulate rope using a soft body.

TODO: applying forces, anchors, soft joints, world info


== Aerodynamics

{url-tutorial}/HelloWind.java[HelloWind] is a SPORT app
that simulates the effect of wind on a flag.

Things notice while running the app:

. The flag is a piece of cloth with 2 of its corners pinned.
. Wind direction is indicated by the white arrow.
. Initially, the wind blows from left to right.
. Press kbd:[Left arrow] and kbd:[Right arrow] to alter the wind direction.


== Clusters

By default, soft-body collisions are handled using nodes and faces.
As an alternative, they can be handled using groups of connected nodes
(called "clusters").
To enable cluster-based rigid-soft collisions for a specific soft body,
set its `CL_RS` collision flag.
To enable cluster-based soft-soft collisions, set its `CL_SS` flag.

Clusters can overlap, but they can't span multiple bodies.
In other words, a single node can belong to multiple clusters,
but a single cluster can't contain nodes from multiple bodies.

When a soft body is created, it doesn't have any clusters.
Once nodes are appended to a body, clusters can be generated automatically,
using an iterative algorithm that's built into Bullet:

[source,java]
----
softBody.generateClusters(k, numIterations);
----


== Summary

* Soft bodies are a convenient and efficient way to simulate
  objects that can be deformed.
