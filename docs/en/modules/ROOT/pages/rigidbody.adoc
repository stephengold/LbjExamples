== The 5 familiar features

A _rigid body_ is a type of collision object
that exhibits some familiar features of real-world objects, including:

* _rigidity_: a fixed shape and
* {url-enwiki}/Inertia[_inertia_]: resistance to changes of motion.

The {url-api}/objects/PhysicsRigidBody.html[`PhysicsRigidBody`] constructor
allows you to specify the new body's mass and collision shape.
Together, these properties determine its
{url-enwiki}/Moment_of_inertia[_moment of inertia_]:

[source,java]
----
CollisionShape ballShape = new SphereCollisionShape(1f);
float ballMass = 2f;
// create a rigid body
PhysicsRigidBody ball = new PhysicsRigidBody(ballShape, ballMass);
// calculate its moment of inertia (in local coordinates, diagonal entries only)
Vector3f inertia = Vector3f.UNIT_XYZ.divide(ball.getInverseInertiaLocal(null));
----

By default, rigid bodies also exhibit 3 other features of real-world objects:

* They are _dynamic_:
  mobile, with their motion determined by
  {url-enwiki}/Force[_forces_],
  {url-enwiki}/Torque[_torques_], and
  {url-enwiki}/Impulse_(physics)[_impulses_].
* They are subject to _gravity_:
  a continual downward force proportional to their mass.
* They exhibit _contact response_:
  powerful forces prevent them from intersecting other bodies.

However, these last 3 features are optional and can easily be disabled.

=== HelloRigidBody

{url-tutorial}/HelloRigidBody.java[HelloRigidBody] is a simple
application that demonstrates the 5 familiar features of rigid bodies.

Things to notice while running the app:

. Two balls, both falling slowly under the influence of gravity.
. The ball on the right receives an impulse that pushes it leftward.
. After the impulse ends, the ball's inertia keeps it moving leftward.
. The simulation runs at 1/10th normal speed.
. The balls collide, generating contact forces
  that alter their motions but not their shapes.
.. The ball on the right loses half its horizontal velocity.
.. The ball on the left begins moving leftward as it falls.

== Configuring rigid bodies

=== Static rigid bodies

Not all rigid bodies are dynamic.
To create a _static_ (non-moving) rigid body,
specify `mass=0` in the constructor.
Unlike a dynamic body,
a static one is unaffected by forces, torques, and impulses,
as if its mass were infinite.

{url-tutorial}/HelloStaticBody.java[HelloStaticBody]
is a simple application that combines static and dynamic rigid bodies.
Things to notice while running the app:

. Two balls: the top one dynamic, the bottom one static.
. The balls collide, generating contact forces
  that alter the path of the dynamic ball.
. The static ball stays fixed in place,
  unaffected by gravity and contact forces.

=== Position

Every rigid body occupies a _position_ in space, described by 2 properties:

* the _location_ of the body's center and
* the body's _orientation_:
  the rotation of its (local) axes relative to those of the physics space.

Each property can be configured separately:

[source,java]
----
body.setPhysicsLocation(new Vector3f(5f, 1f, 0f));
body.setPhysicsRotation(new Quaternion(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f));
----

NOTE: Once a dynamic or static body has been initialized,
it shouldn't be repositioned in this manner.

The center of a dynamic body should be its
{url-enwiki}/Center_of_mass[_center of mass_],
the point around which it tends to spin,
and its local axes should correspond to the
{url-enwiki}/Principal_axis_(mechanics)[_principal axes_]
of its mass distribution.

Unlike a dynamic body, a static body allows complete flexibility
in the choice of center and local axes.

=== Kinematic flag

In addition to static and dynamic rigid bodies, there's a third type.

_Kinematic_ bodies share some properties with both static and dynamic ones.
Like dynamic bodies, kinematic ones can move.
However, they are unaffected by forces, torques, and impulses.
Their movement is dictated by application logic that may, if desired,
reposition them prior to every time step.

In the presence of dynamic bodies, a kinematic body acts like
an irresistible battering ram.

There's no direct way to instantiate a kinematic rigid body.
The usual way is to instantiate a dynamic body and then convert it
to kinematic using `rigidBody.setKinematic(true)`.

Due to a design flaw, a kinematic rigid body must have positive mass.
To convert a static rigid body into a kinematic one, set its mass
to a positive value *before* setting its kinematic flag:

[source,java]
----
rigidBody.setMass(1f);
rigidBody.setKinematic(true);
----

{url-tutorial}/HelloKinematics.java[HelloKinematics]
is a simple application that combines kinematic and dynamic rigid bodies.
Things to notice while running the app:

. Two balls: the top one dynamic, the bottom one kinematic.
. The kinematic ball orbits a fixed point in space.
. The balls collide, generating contact forces
  that affect the motion of the dynamic ball.
. The kinematic ball continues orbiting,
  unaffected by gravity and contact forces.

=== Contact response

When physics simulation detects a collision between
2 bodies that both have contact response, it applies contact forces.

To disable contact response for a particular rigid body,
use `rigidBody.setContactResponse(false)`.

{url-tutorial}/HelloContactResponse.java[HelloContactResponse]
is a simple application that demonstrates contact response.
Things to notice while running the app:

. The ball falls until it collides with the blue (static) box,
  which provides a contact force to halt its motion and counteract gravity.
. Press kbd:[E] to disable the ball's contact response.
. Afterwards, the box no longer exerts any force on the ball.
  Gravity takes over, and the ball falls through the box.

=== Velocity

Every dynamic body has a _velocity_ that quantifies its motion as of the
end of the last time step (or the start of the next).

More precisely, it has 2 velocities: _linear velocity_ and _angular velocity_,
both represented as 3-D vectors.
The magnitude and direction of the linear velocity vector quantify the speed
and direction at which the body's center is traveling through space (if at all).
The magnitude and direction of the angular velocity vector quantify the
rate and axis direction of the body's spinning motion (if any).

NOTE: Both velocities of a static body are zero.

NOTE: Both velocities of a kinematic body are undefined.

To alter the velocities of a dynamic rigid body,
use its `setLinearVelocity()` and `setAngularVelocity()` methods.

=== Built-in forces

Many real-world phenomena can be modeled as forces acting on rigid bodies.

You can apply custom forces, impulses, and torques
using the following 6 methods:

* `applyCentralForce(Vector3f)`
* `applyCentralImpulse(Vector3f)`
* `applyForce(Vector3f force, Vector3f offset)`
* `applyImpulse(Vector3f impulse, Vector3f offset)`
* `applyTorque(Vector3f)`
* `applyTorqueImpulse(Vector3f)`

However, some forces are so commonplace that they are
"built into" rigid-body simulation:

* drag forces:
** damping
* gravity
* contact forces:
** restitution
** friction

==== Damping

In the absence of external forces,
inertia would keep the velocities of a dynamic body constant.
In the real world, however,
we're accustomed to seeing unpowered moving objects eventually come to rest.
This behavior is often caused by _drag forces_ (such as air resistance)
that increase with speed.

To simulate drag forces, each rigid body has _damping_,
which quantifies how quickly its motion decays to zero,
assuming the body is dynamic.

More precisely, each body has 2 damping parameters:
_linear damping_ and _angular damping_,
each of which ranges from zero (no drag) to one (motion ceases immediately).
Linear damping damps the linear velocity, and
angular damping damps the angular velocity.

Accessors are provided for both parameters, separately and together:

[source,java]
----
rigidBody.setAngularDamping(0.5f);  // default=0
rigidBody.setLinearDamping(0.2f);   // default=0
// or alternatively:
float linearDamping = 0.5f;
float angularDamping = 0.2f;
rigidBody.setDamping(linearDamping, angularDamping);
----

{url-tutorial}/HelloDamping.java[HelloDamping]
is a simple application that demonstrates damping.
Things to notice while running the app:

. 4 cubes initially share the same linear and angular velocities.
. The top 2 have constant linear velocities, evidence of no linear damping.
. The left 2 have constant angular velocities, evidence of no angular damping.
. The linear velocities of the bottom 2 cubes decay quickly to zero
  due to strong linear damping.
. The angular velocities of the right 2 cubes decay quickly to zero
  due to strong angular damping.

==== Gravity

In the real world,
we're accustomed to seeing unsupported objects fall.
This behavior is caused by _gravity_,
a downward force that's proportional to mass (and thus causes a constant
{url-enwiki}/Acceleration[acceleration]).

To simulate this phenomenon, each body has a gravity vector
that quantifies the acceleration, assuming the body is dynamic.
To configure a body's gravity, use `setGravity(accelerationVector)`.

NOTE: If following the Y-up axes convention, the X and Z components of the
vector should be zero, and its Y component should be *negative*.

To disable gravity for a particular rigid body,
use `rigidBody.setGravity(Vector3f.ZERO)`.

When a body is added to a physics space,
the gravity of the space typically gets applied to it,
replacing any previously configured gravity.

To disable gravity for a particular physics space and all bodies in it,
use `physicsSpace.setGravity(Vector3f.ZERO)`.

To protect a rigid body from gravity changes caused by the space
to which it's added, use `rigidBody.setProtectGravity(true)`.

To simulate a non-uniform gravitational field,
update the gravity of each body prior to each physics tick.
{url-tutorial}/HelloNonUniformGravity.java[HelloNonUniformGravity]
is a simple application that demonstrates this technique.
The planet orbits a black hole whose location is indicated by colored arrows.

NOTE: The planet's path varies somewhat from orbit to orbit.
This is partly due to inaccuracies of single-precision arithmetic.

==== Restitution

When responsive rigid bodies collide,
contact forces come into play, altering their velocities.
These forces are split into 2 components:  restitution and friction.

_Restitution_ is a force parallel to the contact normal.
Its strength hints at what the bodies might be made out of.

If both bodies were made of hard, springy steel,
they might separate without loss of
{url-enwiki}/Kinetic_energy[kinetic energy],
after undergoing what's called a _perfectly elastic_ collision.
If, on the other hand, both bodies were made of soft, sticky clay,
they might cling together, dissipating kinetic energy and
undergoing what's called a _perfectly inelastic_ collision.

In reality, no collision is perfectly elastic.
Elasticity is quantified by a _coefficient of restitution_,
which ranges from zero (perfectly inelastic) to one (perfectly elastic).

In simulation, collisions are inelastic by default.
(We saw this in {url-tutorial}/HelloRigidBody.java[HelloRigidBody.java].)
Each rigid body has a _restitution parameter_, which defaults to zero.
For each collision, the coefficient of restitution
is calculated by multiplying the parameters of the colliding bodies.

To simulate a perfectly elastic collision, set the restitution parameters of
both bodies to one:

[source,java]
----
rigidBodyA.setRestitution(1f); // default=0
rigidBodyB.setRestitution(1f);
----

{url-examples}/NewtonsCradle.java[The Newton's Cradle demo]
demonstrates perfectly elastic collisions.
At startup, the simulation is paused.
Press kbd:[.] to start the simulation, or to pause it while it's running.

==== Friction

While restitution models contact forces parallel to the contact normal,
_friction_ models contact forces orthogonal to the contact normal.

Each rigid body has a _friction parameter_ (which defaults to 0.5).
This parameter hints at the body's surface characteristics.
To configure the parameter, use `setFriction(parameter)`.
Reducing a body's friction parameter makes it more slippery (think wet ice).
Increasing it yields better traction (think sandpaper or dry rubber).

For each collision, a _coefficient of friction_
is calculated by multiplying the parameters of the colliding bodies.

== Deactivation

It's common for physics simulations to reach a
{url-enwiki}/Steady_state[_steady state_] in which
the some or all of the rigid bodies have stopped moving.
If a dynamic rigid body doesn't move for 2 seconds,
the simulator may automatically _deactivate_ it to reduce CPU consumption.

To prevent a body from being deactivated,
a certain amount of movement, either linear or angular,
needs to occur every 2 seconds.
Accessors are provided for these thresholds:

[source,java]
----
float linearThreshold = 0.5f; // default=0.8
float angularThreshold = 0.2f; // default=1
rigidBody.setSleepingThresholds(linearThreshold, angularThreshold);
----

NOTE: _Sleeping_ is synonym for deactivation.

To disable deactivation for a particular rigid body,
use `physicsSpace.setEnableSleep(false)`.

To test whether a body is deactivated, use `rigidBody.isActive()`.

Deactivated bodies won't be simulated (and won't move)
unless/until they get reactivated.
Reactivation occurs when:

* a new contact is added (due to a collision),
* a custom force, torque, or impulse is applied, or
* the `rigidBody.activate()` method is invoked.

To reactivate all bodies in a particular physics space,
use `physicsSpace.activateAll(true)`.

Puzzling behavior may occur if a deactivated body is:

* supported by another body that then gets removed,
* supported by another body that then has its contact response disabled, or
* driven by a motorized physics joint.

The deactivated body will seem to be "stuck"
because the events listed above do not, by themselves, reactivate it.

{url-tutorial}/HelloDeactivation.java[HelloDeactivation]
is a simple application that demonstrates deactivation.
Things to notice while running the app:

. The upper (dynamic) box falls until it collides with the lower (static) box,
  which provides a contact force to halt its motion and counteract gravity.
. About 2 seconds after the upper box stops moving, it gets deactivated.
. After the application removes the lower box,
  the upper box doesn't resuming falling.
  Due to deactivation, it seems to be "stuck".

== Continuous collision detection

A common issue with discrete-time simulations
involves a fast-moving dynamic body passing through a thin obstacle
without any collision being detected.
The issue arises because the body can pass from one side of the obstacle to
the other in a single time step.
The dynamic body doesn't intersect the obstacle on any time step,
so no collision is detected and no contact forces are simulated.

To some extent, this issue could be mitigated by reducing the time step.
But since CPU consumption is inversely proportional to the time step,
this approach quickly becomes inefficient.

To solve this issue,
the simulator offers _continuous collision detection_ (CCD),
an algorithm for detecting collisions that occur *between* time steps.
CCD substitutes a sphere for the collision shape of the fast-moving body,
sweeps that sphere forward along the body's projected path,
and then performs more detailed collision tests on any potential
obstacles found by the sweep.

Because CCD involves extra computation, it's disabled by default.
Since it's only necessary for fast-moving bodies, it's enabled only
when a body's distance traveled per time step exceeds a threshold.
To enable CCD for a particular rigid body,
set its activation threshold to a positive value using
`rigidBody.setCcdMotionThreshold(distancePerTimeStep)`.

To obtain the best possible results from CCD,
tune both the motion threshold and the size of the swept sphere.
Here's a heuristic that works well for many situations:

[source,java]
----
if (rigidBody.isDynamic()) {
    CollisionShape shape = rigidBody.getCollisionShape();
    float radius = shape.maxRadius();
    rigidBody.setCcdMotionThreshold(radius);
    rigidBody.setCcdSweptSphereRadius(radius);
}
----

{url-tutorial}/HelloCcd.java[HelloCcd]
is a simple application that demonstrates CCD.
Things to notice while running the app:

. The 2 balls have the same size, mass, initial height, and initial velocity.
. The simulation runs at 1/10th normal speed,
  making the time steps noticeable.
. The ball with CCD enabled (on the left) sticks the landing on the platform.
. The control ball (on the right) falls through the platform,
  passing from one side to the other in a single time step.
