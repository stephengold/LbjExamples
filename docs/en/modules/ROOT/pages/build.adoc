= How to build Libbulletjme from source
:Project: Libbulletjme

{Project} is free, open-source software.

While pre-built artifacts (including JARs and native libraries)
can be downloaded from GitHub and the Maven Central Repository,
some people prefer to build them from source.

You can also build a local copy of the documentation (website content).
This is useful if you are editing the content,
or if your Internet access is limited or unreliable.

== JARs and native libraries

Here's the recommended procedure:

. Install build software:
.. a https://adoptium.net/releases.html[Java Development Kit (JDK)],
  if you don't already have one, and
.. one of the supported C++ compilers:
... for Linux:  the https://gcc.gnu.org/[GNU Compiler Collection] or https://www.llvm.org[Clang]
... for Windows:  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com[Microsoft Visual Studio]
... for macOS:  https://developer.apple.com/xcode[Xcode]
. Point the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your JDK installation:
  (The path might be something like "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_301"
  or "/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/" or
  "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/liberica-jdk-17-full.jdk/Contents/Home" .)
.. using Bash or Zsh: `export JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `set JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
.. using PowerShell: `$env:JAVA_HOME = '` *path to installation* `'`
. Download and extract the {Project} source code from GitHub:
.. using Git:
... `git clone https://github.com/stephengold/Libbulletjme.git`
... `cd Libbulletjme`
... `git checkout -b latest 18.6.0`
.. using a web browser:
... browse to https://github.com/stephengold/Libbulletjme/releases/latest
... follow the "Source code (zip)" link
... save the ZIP file
... extract the contents of the saved ZIP file
... `cd` to the extracted directory
. Run the Gradle wrapper on the desktop build script:
.. using Bash or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew build`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew build`
. Building Android native libraries requires additional software:
.. the Android SDK Tools
.. the Android SDK Patch Applier (patcher)
.. version 21.3.6528147 of the Android Native Development Kit (NDK)
. Run the Gradle wrapper on the Android build script:
.. using Bash or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew copyToDist --build-file=android.gradle`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew copyToDist --build-file=android.gradle`

After a successful build,
artifacts and native libraries will be found in the "dist" directory.

=== Install artifacts

You can install the built artifacts to your local Maven repository:

* using Bash or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew install`
* using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew install`

=== Cleanup

After a build, you can restore the project to a pristine state:

* using Bash or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew clean`
* using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew clean`

== Website content

. Download and extract the source code from GitHub:
.. `git clone https://github.com/stephengold/LbjExamples.git`
.. `cd LbjExamples`
. Edit "docs/playbook.yml" and replace "/home/sgold/NetBeansProjects/LbjExamples"
  with an absolute path to your checkout directory (2 places).
. https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/install-and-run-quickstart/#install-nodejs[Install Node.js]
. Run Antora:
.. `npx antora docs/playbook.yml`

After a successful build,
the local copy of the site will be found in the "docs/build/site" directory.
